---

## **Introduction**

You are viewing a UI pattern library, a component library built on Fractal. It builds websites in a modular fashion, beaking up the UI into small, reusable chunks that can then later be assembled in a variety of way to build anything from larger components right up to whole pages.

Fractal helps assemble, preview and document website component library.

## **Requirements**

UI-Collection is build upon Fractal, a tool that enables the rapid development of components, templates and pages. Fractal uses a number of ES6 features, so this project requires Node.js v4.0+ to be installed locally. A global install of Gulp is also recommended.

## **Installation**

To get the project up and running, and view components in the browser:

- Download and install Node
- Clone this repo
- Install Fractal globally: `npm install fractal -g`
- Install project dependancies: `npm install`

## **Start the development server**

- Open up your terminal and run: `fractal start --sync`
- Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000
